[OpenDirect_OOH_LineOptimisation.xlsx](https://github.com/Outsmart-OOH/ooh_open_direct/blob/master/examples/Worksheets/OpenDirect_OOH_LineOptimisation.xlsx) shows how an order of 184 lines could be compressed into 1 line by using the OOHbject object.

[Time Zone Example Coded.xlsx](https://github.com/Outsmart-OOH/ooh_open_direct/blob/master/examples/Worksheets/Time%20Zone%20Example%20Coded.xlsx) shows how the TimeZone OOHbject Value can be used to ensure global booking of a campaign can play out to a universal or local timezone. It also shows the effect of a booking stradling a 'daylight savings time' event (where time is lost or gained, depending on the seasonal shift).
